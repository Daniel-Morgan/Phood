                    <h5>Tips for creating a popular recipe:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use capital letters in your recipe name</li>
                        <li>The description is your time to shine, describe clearly and effectively what makes your
                            recipe great. Include
                            why others might like it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not use fractions. Phood uses decimals for quantity information since using many
                            different measurement
                            systems may confuse our users.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Units should be in title case format. Eg. <strong>"Cups"</strong>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h5>Searching for other recipes</h5>
                    <p>You can search for any recipes that you or other users have created using the search bar at the
                        top of the page.
                        You can search using a</p>
